    "Freeciv is a turn-based strategy game, in which each player becomes the leader of a civilization. You compete against several opponents to found cities, use them to support a military and economy, and finally to complete an empire that survives all encounters with its neighbors to emerge victorious. Each opponent may be either another human or be controlled by the computer. All players begin at the dawn of history with a handful of units -- typically with an explorer and a couple of settlers in 4000 BCE -- and race to expand outward from those humble beginnings.": "",
    "Achieving success requires a balance between economic expansion, military strength, and technological development. Not only must you develop all three in concert to both expand and successfully defend your empire, but any of the three may provide victory over your opponents:": "",
    " - As in other games of conquest and expansion, you are declared the winner by default once the last city and unit of every other civilization is destroyed.": "",
    " - Once technological progress has brought you into the space age, you may launch a spacecraft destined for Alpha Centauri; the first civilization whose craft reaches the system wins.": "",

    " 0. Choosing the first city site.\n 1. Mapping the countryside.\n 2. Defending the cities.\n 3. Deciding which units to build first.\n 4. Improving the land.\n 5. Deciding where to build cities.\n 6. Taking care of the cities.\n 7. Interacting with other players (diplomacy).\n 8. Exploring the world.\n 9. Things to keep in mind.\n10. Making your own strategy for the game.\n": " 0. 选择第一个城市的位置。\n 1. 探索周围的地图。\n 2. 防御城市。\n 3. 确定首先建造什么部队。\n 4. 修建农业设施。\n 5. 确定在哪里建造城市。\n 6. 管理城市。\n 7. 探索世界。\n 8. 需要注意的事项。\n 9. 制定您自己的游戏策略。\n10. 同其他玩家交互（外交）。\n",
    " 0. Choosing the first city site.\n\n    Start the game by wandering around BRIEFLY to find a good place to build the first city.  Don't feel tempted to investigate any yellow-roofed villages yet - they might contain barbarian tribes.  Build the city close to resources and perhaps close to the sea.  Keep in mind that the city you build first will be your capital!  The idea is to balance the quality of the site you find against getting your first city established as early as possible.": " 0. 选择第一个城市的位置。\n\n    游戏开始时短暂地四处游走一下以为建造第一个城市找到一个好地方。先不要被黄色屋顶的村庄所吸引－它们可能拥有野人部落。建造城市时靠近物资并可能靠近海洋。记住您第一个建造的城市将是您的首都！要领是在您所找到位置的质量和尽早建立您的第一个城市之间进行平衡。",
    " 1. Mapping the countryside.\n\n    After the capital city has been founded, it will start producing a warrior unit.  These units can be used to rove around exploring the countryside.  Remember, it is risky to leave a city undefended, so perhaps keep the first warrior in the city, and use the following one to explore.  If you started the game with an explorer unit, use that to explore, obviously!": " 1. 探索周围的地图。\n\n    首都城市建立后，它将开始生产武士。这些部队可以被用来在四周漫游以探索周围。记住，留下城市没有防御是危险的，所以或许应该把第一个武士留在城市里，利用第二个去探路。如果游戏开始时您有一个冒险家，显然用他去探路！",
    " 2. Defending the cities.\n\n    At this point, defend your cities by always leaving a warrior unit in them.  As your civilization develops units with a greater defense strength, replace the obsolete units with new ones to ensure your cities have maximum defense.  The units most often used for defense are (in order of strength):  Warrior, Phalanx, Pikemen, Musketeers, and Riflemen.": " 2. 防御城市。\n\n    在这个阶段，通过总是在城市中留下一个武士来防御。随着您的文明发展出更强防御力的部队，用它替换旧的部队以使您的城市具有最大防守能力。最常用来防守的部队是（按防御能力排序）：武士，希腊方阵，长枪兵，火枪手，和步枪兵。",
    "    Keep in mind that with some types of government, military units inside or outside cities can reduce or create unhappiness. Also remember that when a land unit is inside a city, it gets a 50% defensive bonus, as if fortified.  When a new city is built, the city starts to build the best available defensive unit from the above list.": "    要记住在某些政府类型下，城市内外的军事部队将产生或降低忧郁。还要记住当一个部队在城市里时，它获得50%的防守奖励，就像它已设防一样。当建成一座新城市时，它开始生产上面的列表中可用的最强的防御部队。",
    " 3. Deciding which units to build first.\n\n    After building one or two Warrior units, start building Settlers.  Settlers are best put to use founding new cities; while they can also build agricultural improvements (see the next section), it is better to use Workers for this when available, as unlike Settlers, Workers do not consume food from their parent city.  Keep in mind that a large population increases both the amount of productivity and your civilization's research rate, not to mention that cities secure land for your empire, so founding new cities should be a high priority initially.": " 3. 确定首先建造的部队。\n\n    建造一个或两个武士部队后，请开始建造移民者。第二个移民者可以用来修建公路或灌溉靠近城市的田野，第三个可以用来修建一个新城市。或者，你可以用第二个移民者修建另外一个城市，并使用第三个进行对城市周围田野的农业设施。记住越多的人口将增加您的生产力和您文明的科研比率。",
    " 4. Improving the land.\n\n    Each city has an area of land around it that can be used for growing food, producing goods, and generating trade.  This output can be increased by using Workers (or Settlers) to improve the land close to your cities.  The land can be improved with irrigation (increasing food), roads (allowing units to move faster and increasing trade), and mines (increasing production), among other improvements.": " 4. 修建农业设施。\n\n    每个城市在其周围有区域的田野可以用来生长粮食，出产物资，以及产生贸易。这些可以通过用移民者改进田野来增加产出。土地可以使用公路，水里，矿井和其它设施来改进。",
    " 5. Deciding where to build cities.\n\n    The best location for a city is a matter of taste.  A city which is placed near the sea is easier to spot by opponents, but can also serve as a port for sea-going units.  (They also usually need a coastal defense later on.)  The best strategy is to build a few of both, but keep in mind that your opponents will find it harder to locate your city if you don't build it by the sea.": " 5. 确定在哪里建造城市。\n\n    城市的最佳位置是个人品味问题。靠近海洋的城市容易被对方发现，但是可以作为出海部队的港口。（这些城市通常后面都需要一个海岸防御。）最佳的策略是两种都建一些，但是要记住如果您没有靠海建造城市，您的对手将更难发现它们。",
    " 6. Taking care of the cities.\n\n    Every city has a band of citizens.  The number of citizens depends on the city's population.  When you click on a city, you can see how the land around the city is being used.  You can assign your citizens to the land, or they can be specialists that contribute to your civilization in other ways.  Especially at the start of the game, care should be taken to ensure that the citizens are employed so that they maximize growth, trade and production.": " 6. 管理城市。\n\n    每个城市都有一组市民。市民的数目取决于成熟的人口。单击一个城市的时候，您可以看到城市周围的田野是如何被使用的。您可以指派您的市民到田野工作，或者它们可以成为科学家，艺人，或者税务员。特别是在游戏开始的时候，需要注意让市民合适工作以使增长，贸易和物资最大化。",
    "    If too much food is being generated, a citizen can be taken off the land by clicking on the occupied land tile.  This citizen can then be transferred to the other duties mentioned previously.": "    如果产生了太多的食物，可以通过单击所在的田野方格撤回市民。然后这个市民可以被改变成前面所述的其它职业者。",
    "    If you move all of your citizens into the city and right-click on the central tile of the land, the citizens will be rearranged to maximize food production.": "    如果您把所有的市民都撤回城里然后右键单击中间的田野方格，市民将会按照最大化食物生产的方式被重新安排。",
    "    The golden rule of taking care of a city is that there should be at least as many happy citizens as unhappy citizens.  A city where this is not so falls into disorder; such cities are labeled with a raised fist or a lightning bolt (depending on the tileset).  Take care not to let this happen to any of your cities, as cities in disorder produce nothing, and are prone to revolt.": "    管理城市的黄金法则是，快乐市民的数目至少要等于忧郁市民的数目相等。不满足这个条件的城市将被标识上一条闪电。一定注意不要让您的城市发生这种情况，因为忧郁的城市什么也不生产，并且很快会发生起义。",
    " 7. Interacting with other players (diplomacy).\n\n    When one of your units first meets a unit of another nation, or finds one of their cities (or equally if they find you), a basic contact is established between the two nations.  This provides each with basic intelligence about the other, which can be accessed from the 'Nations' report.": "",
    "    This communication will lapse after a set number of turns with no contact.  Establishing an embassy will give a more permanent communication channel, as well as more advanced intelligence such as details of technology.  Embassies are one-way - the nation hosting the embassy receives no benefit - and once established, cannot be revoked.": "",
    "    If you are in contact with another player, then you can arrange a diplomatic meeting.  From the 'Nations' report, this is done by clicking on the nation with whom you wish to meet and selecting 'Meet'.  If the entry under the embassy column is not blank and the other player is connected (or is a server AI) then a treaty dialog will pop up.": " 10. 同其他玩家交互（外交）。\n\n    如果您最近遇到了（或者与他建立了使馆）另一个玩家，那么您就可以安排一次外交会晤。这通过如下步骤完成：打开“报告”菜单，选择“玩家”，单击您想会晤的玩家，并从“玩家”菜单中选择“会晤”命令。如果使馆一列中的内容不为空并且对方玩家是已经连接进来的（或者是一个服务器AI），游戏就会弹出一个外交菜单。",
    "    In this dialog you can negotiate an exchange of assets (maps, vision, advances, cities, or gold), embassies, or binding pacts such as a cease-fire or peace.  There is no need to trade like for like; you can trade, say, an advance or city for gold - you can consider this buying and selling.": "",
    "    Pacts affect where your units can go and what they can do, and a pact with one nation can affect your relations with others.  Under authoritarian governments such as Monarchy you can break a pact at any time, but the representative governments (Republic and Democracy) have a senate which will block the unprovoked cancelation of a treaty; unless a foreign Diplomat or Spy sparks a diplomatic incident, the only way to dissolve a pact in this situation is to dissolve your government.  The details of pacts are described in the Diplomacy section.": "",
    "    A couple of notes:": "",
    "   - You can't give away your capital.": "",
    "   - You can only request property that you know about; so you can't request technology unless you have an embassy, and if you can't see a city on your map, then you can't request it.  Of course, the owner of that city can still offer it to you, in which case the area around the city is shown on your map before you accept the treaty.": "",
    "   - One important thing to note: when a city is transferred, any units in the field and supported by that city are also transferred (but not those sitting in other cities).  So make sure the other player isn't getting a better deal than you expect.": "     当然，城市的主人还是能够把它割让给你，这种情况下该城市周围的地区将会显示在您的地图上。一个需要注意的重要问题是：在该城市中的任何部队以及该城市所支持的部队（但不包括停留在其他城市的部队）也一起被转让。所以要确认对方玩家没有得到比你期望的更多。",
    " 8. Exploring the world.\n\n    After you have fortified your cities with troops, build Triremes in the cities near the sea.  Use the Triremes to map the world in search of opponents and new lands.  If you are on an island, you should spend less on military and more on expansion.  Or if you are located close to an opponent, it is truly a good idea to make a peace treaty and share the advances you have made. Diplomatic units are very useful here, and WILL pay off later.": " 7. 探索世界。\n\n    在用部队为您的城市设防之后，在靠海的城市中修建三层桨座帆船。利用这些帆船探索世界，发现对手和新陆地。如果您位于一个岛屿上，您应该花费更多在扩张上，在军事上花费少些。或者如果您位于靠近一个对手的地方，同他达成一个和平协定并共享您的科技进展真的是一个好主意。这种情况下外交部队和很有用，并将在后面给出回报。",
    " 9. Things to keep in mind.\n\n  - What the next advance you'll need is.\n\n  - What your tax, luxury and research rates are currently set to.\n\n  - Treaties are often broken, so don't neglect defense...\n\n  - Some wonders can be made obsolete by the development of certain advances.": " 8. 需要注意的事项。\n\n  - 您下一步需要什么科技进展。\n\n  - 您的税收，娱乐和科研比率当前设置为什么。\n\n  - 协定经常被撕毁，所以不要忽视防守……\n\n  - 有些奇迹会被特定科技进展所淘汰。",

    "Terrain serves three roles: the theater upon which your units battle rival civilizations, the landscape across which your units travel, and the medium which your cities work to produce resources. The different types of terrain each have different strengths and drawbacks; see the sections on each terrain type for details.": "",
    "Terrain affects combat very simply: when a land unit is attacked, its defense strength is multiplied by the defense factor (\"bonus\") of the terrain beneath it. See the help section on Combat for further details.": "",
    "Terrain complicates the movement of land units -- sea and air units always expend one movement point to move one tile, but moving onto rough terrain such as Mountains can cost land units more.": "",
    "Tiles within range of a city may be worked by that city to produce food, production, and trade points, and the quantity of each produced depends on the terrain. These three products are so important that we specify the output of a tile simply by listing them with slashes in between: for example, \"1/2/0\" describes a tile that each turn when it is being worked produces one food point, two production points, and no trade points. In addition to the characteristic output of the terrain, some tiles have an additional special resource that boosts one or two of the products. See the Economy section for more information on the use of these products.": "",
    "The net benefit of a tile for your city depends on your government type as well as city improvements and wonders.": "一个方格对您城市的最终好处取决于您的政府类型以及城市建筑和奇迹。",
    "It is possible for your units to change the terrain and hence its effects; see the section on Terrain Alterations for more details. City centers (the tile a city is on) may get some of these benefits for free; see the section on Cities for more detail.": "",
    " Resources": "矿产",
    "Tiles can have natural resources in addition to their base terrain.": "",
    " Terrain Alterations": " 地形变更",
    "Certain units (Settlers, Workers, and Engineers in the classic ruleset) have the ability to alter terrain tiles in several ways. The following description uses the classic ruleset to illustrate this; other rulesets may have different rules, or even omit some of these alterations entirely.": "",
    "Irrigation systems can be built on suitable types of terrain; these cause a tile to produce some extra food each turn. There may be restrictions on where an irrigation system can be built; for instance, in the classic ruleset, a water source is required. See the ruleset help for details. However, once irrigated, land remains so even if its requirements are removed.": "",
    "In some rulesets, given sufficient technology, you may upgrade an irrigation system on a tile into even more productive Farmland, by irrigating it a second time.": "",
    "Mines can be built on some types of terrain, which increases the number of production points (shields) produced by that tile.": "某些类型的地形可以修建矿井，这可以增加该方格的物资产出。",
    "Units may be able to build other terrain improvements; see the following sections for details. Roads typically ease movement, if adjacent tiles have the same road, and bases often provide protection and refueling. Such improvements can also provide other bonuses such as production bonuses; this is up to the ruleset.": "",
    "Terrain can sometimes be permanently converted into a type more suitable to the player's needs, although this usually takes longer than adding an improvement. Converting terrain from one type to another in this way may destroy existing improvements, if the new terrain is unsuitable, and may also remove access to special resources if they were specific to the original terrain type.": "",
    "The requirements for terrain conversion are set by the ruleset. It can be initiated in several ways:": "",
    " - By issuing \"irrigate\" or \"mine\" orders when on terrain unsuitable for such improvements.": "",
    " - By issuing the special \"transform\" order. This often causes more radical transformations.": "",
    "In some rulesets, units can even reclaim land from water tiles, and similarly land can be transformed to water, although such radical transformations may require a certain number of surrounding tiles to already be land or water respectively. Terrain-altering units that cannot reach the existing terrain may have to be loaded onto a suitable vessel, and if necessary and possible, they will move to safe neighboring tiles when the conversion is complete.": "",
    "Many units -- in the classic rules, all land units -- also have the ability to destroy terrain alterations, by pillaging. Terrain conversions cannot be undone by pillaging; for example, in the classic ruleset, if a Forest tile has been irrigated to convert it into a Plain, you cannot convert it back into a Forest by pillaging -- to do so, you would have to convert the tile again with a Settler, Worker, or Engineer.": "没有更改（农场，水利，矿井，要塞，空军基地，铁路或公路）的地形不能被掠夺。另外，地形的转变和改造不能通过掠夺而被取消。例如，如果您灌溉了一个森林方格而把它转变成了平原，掠夺并不能把它转变回森林－－要想这样，您必须用移民者或工程师再对方格进行一次转变。",
    "The time it takes a unit to alter terrain depends on its movement rate. The following table shows the number of turns required for a unit with 1 movement point to complete an activity; these numbers are reduced for units with faster move rates (such as Engineers in the classic ruleset). The time taken can be reduced further by several units working together as a team; if two or more units are working on the same task on the same tile, their efforts will be added together each turn until the task is finished. Be careful not to dedicate too many units to one task, though; excess effort can be wasted, and groups of terrain improving units are often vulnerable to enemy attacks.": "工人是游戏中的关键部队之一。它们可被用来灌溉土地，修筑公路，铁路，要塞，空军基地和矿井，并清除污染与核辐射。\n\n移民者，工人和工程师可以合作以减少一些任务所需要的时间。如果两个或多个工人/工程师都在同一方格上进行相同任务，它们的作用每回合都会累加起来直到任务完成。但注意不要在一个回合中投入太多的工作者，多余的作用将会被浪费，并且对敌人的攻击来说一组工人/移民者/工程师太脆弱了。",
    " National Borders": "国家边界",
    "If enabled on the server, each nation has borders, which can be seen as dotted lines on the map. Borders determine what land your citizens can work and where you can found new cities, and whether your units are considered to be aggressively deployed by your citizens (see the section on Happiness). Borders also come into play when there is a diplomatic pact between nations (see the section on Diplomacy).": "",
    "Founding a city establishes a claim on an area of land around the city. In the classic ruleset, once claimed, a tile that can be directly worked by a city can not change ownership unless the city does (or is destroyed). However, the ownership of land that is out of range of any city can change depending on factors such as the relative size of nearby nations' cities. Other rulesets may differ in which, if any, tiles are permanently claimed by a city.": "",
    "Normally borders extend into water only for tiles adjacent to a city; beyond that, only narrow inlets and inland lakes can usually be claimed. Some rulesets may allow water tiles to be claimed as easily as land tiles in some circumstances, although the classic ruleset does not. Border claims can never extend to remote islands.": "",
    "Bases can also extend national borders. See the help on Terrain Alterations for more details.": "",
    "The products which your cities extract from the surrounding terrain are the fountain from which your civilization is watered. There are three types of products: food points, production points, and trade points. The following sections describe each of these resources along with its properties, uses, and limitations.": "",
    " Food": "食物",
    "Your population needs food to survive. Each citizen requires two food points per turn; in addition, some units (such as Settlers in the classic ruleset) may require food points from the city supporting them.": "",
    "Every city has a granary for storing food points (the building called a Granary in the classic ruleset only enhances this capability). Cities producing more food than they require accumulate the surplus in their granary, while those producing less than they require deplete their granary. When food is needed but none remains, the city population starves, killing food-consuming units first, followed by citizens, until the food deficit ends.": "",
    "Excess food can increase the population: the city granary has a limited capacity, and once full the city grows by one citizen and the granary starts again at empty. But since granary capacity increases with population, each citizen is more costly than the last, making this mode of growth important only for small cities. (An alternative way for cities to grow is \"rapture\", described in the section on Happiness.)": "",
    " Production": "生产",
    "Production points (also known as \"shields\") represent manufacturing output. Most units require production points as upkeep, and demand them from their home city, although under autocratic regimes each city supports a few units for free. If city production drops too low, the units that cannot be supported are automatically disbanded. Most types of unit can also be disbanded at any time. If a unit is disbanded while in a city, half of its production cost will usually be put towards that city's surplus.": "",
    "Production points in excess of any required by the city's units are put towards whichever unit, building, or wonder has been selected as the city's current product. Just as food points accumulate in the city granary and yield a citizen when it reaches full, so production points accumulate until the cost of the product has been achieved. Products appear in their city when complete -- units appear on the map while improvements and wonders are added to their city's list of structures. Any leftover production points remain available to be applied towards the next project.": "",
    "In the classic ruleset, a city can build at most one product per turn, regardless of its production surplus. However, in some rulesets, factors such as city size and technology may enable a single city to produce more than one unit in a single turn under certain conditions. A city with multiple \"build slots\", ordered to build a unit, can build as many of that single kind of unit per turn as its production surplus allows, up to the number of slots. Units which cost city population to build are an exception to this rule; they can only be built singly, as can buildings.": "",
    "A city can be given a list of several products to build in its \"worklist\", avoiding the need to pay attention to it every few turns. Each item on the worklist represents a single product (such as a unit); the city will work through them in order. When a city has finished all the work you have given it to do, it will try to build the last item again if possible, otherwise it will choose a new target itself. If a city is currently producing gold (building Coinage in the classic rules), an activity which never completes, putting an item on its worklist will cause it to stop producing gold and start working on the new item next turn. In rulesets which permit it, a city may take several units of the same type off its worklist in a single turn, but if a different kind of item is reached, production pauses until the following turn. This can be used to limit the number of units produced by highly productive cities.": "",
    "Each player is free to build any products that his technology has made available, with a few restrictions; see the sections on Units, City Improvements, and Wonders of the World for more information. Be careful -- the game even gives you the freedom to produce units you cannot support and buildings whose upkeep you cannot afford, both of which will be disbanded immediately after completion.": "",
    "You can always change the product on which a city is working, though you lose half of the accumulated production points when switching from a building, unit, or wonder to a product from one of the other two categories. You can spend gold to complete a project in one turn by hitting the Buy button on the city dialog.": "",
    "Some production points may be lost to waste, although there is no waste in the classic rules. Waste can result in your cities not building anything.": "",
    "Cities with a large production output generate pollution; see the section on Cities for more information.": "",
    " Trade": "贸易",
    "Trade points reflect wealth generated in each city by external commerce. Some trade points may be lost to corruption, which varies among forms of government, and tends to increase with distance from your center of government. Each city distributes its remaining trade points among three uses: gold, in the form of taxes, goes into your national treasury; luxury points influence citizen morale; and science points (\"bulbs\") contribute towards the discovery of new technology.": "",
    "You must choose a single ratio for your civilization by which trade points are distributed among these three uses. Though you may alter the tax rates on any turn, you are constrained to multiples of ten percent, and most forms of government limit their maximum value.": "",
    "Having this single ratio does not impact gold and science, because gold and technological progress are both empire-wide tallies. Luxury is more problematic, however, because its effect is local -- it affects only the city producing it. Thus, while it would be convenient for unhappy cities to invest all their trade in luxury while others invested in science or taxes instead, you will instead have to compromise among the needs of all your cities (although there may be ways to make local adjustments, such as assigning citizens as entertainers in the classic ruleset). See the section on Happiness for more details on the effect of luxuries.": "",
    "Besides working terrain gifted with rare commodities, or logistical benefits such as waterways or roads, you can increase trade by using units to establish permanent trade routes between two cities, if the ruleset allows it.": "",
    "The ruleset may limit the ability to trade or the yield from doing so depending on whether the two cities are on different continents and/or in different nations; for international trade routes, on the diplomatic status of the two trade partners; and for domestic routes, there must be a minimum distance between the two cities, controlled by the 'trademindist' server option (default nine tiles).": "",
    "A trade route is established when a suitable unit (in the classic ruleset, a Caravan or Freight unit) enters an eligible city. For your own or allied cities, you need to issue the \"Establish Trade Route\" command. This creates a trade route between the unit's home city (which might be different from the city that originally produced it) and the destination.": "",
    "The origin civilization of the unit gains immediate revenue in gold and science from selling its trade goods at the destination city. The initial revenue depends on the trade already produced by the two cities involved and their distance apart. The destination civilization learns about the location of the origin city, if it is not already known.": "",
    "The ongoing trade route that is established benefits both its origin and destination cities equally by generating trade points for each city every turn. The amount of ongoing trade increases with the size of each city and the distance between them, and may also depend on the factors mentioned above. The trade relationship also gives each civilization limited ongoing intelligence about the partner city. If a trade route ever becomes unsustainable -- for instance, if war breaks out in a ruleset where enemies cannot trade -- it may be permanently canceled.": "",
    "Each city can only support a limited number of trade routes (the exact limit is set by ruleset and circumstance). If you attempt to establish more, the trade route with the smallest ongoing revenue is canceled if it would be less than the new route. (Otherwise, the origin civilization can still gain initial revenue by entering the marketplace and selling trade goods, but it is reduced to a third.)": "",
    "This limit is enforced only when attempting to establish a new route. If you temporarily lose the ability to establish as many trade routes as a city already has, existing ones are not affected.": "",
    "Beware: in rulesets where plague is enabled, it can travel along trade routes. See the section on Plague for more details.": "",
    "To view the current trade routes of a city, click and hold over the Trade: line in the Overview tab in the city view.": "",
    " Goods": "百万货物",
    "Goods are carried via trade routes.": "已建立的贸易路线",
    "Cities are your sole instrument for developing natural resources and channeling them toward expansion, technological progress, and warfare.": "",
    "A city is created when Settlers are given the \"build city\" command on suitable terrain, removing the unit from play to provide the city with its first citizens. A city may grow to include dozens of citizens, some working within the city while others are dispatched as new settlers. Famine, war, and plague kill citizens and reduce population; with the loss of its last citizen a city disappears (in the classic ruleset, this can leave ruins, although these have no effect on gameplay).": "",
    "Each city may work the terrain within its reach. In the classic ruleset, this is a fixed radius of approximately three tiles, giving access to 20 tiles on rectangular maps, or 18 tiles on hexagonal ones, in addition to the city center tile. In other rulesets it may be different, and may vary depending on factors such as the size of the city and known technologies.": "",
    "To extract resources from a tile, you must have a citizen working there. You cannot begin working a tile which a neighboring city is already working, nor can you work terrain upon which an enemy unit is standing, or terrain inside another player's borders. Thus you can simulate conditions of siege by stationing your units atop valuable resources around an enemy city. Units can also be ordered to pillage, which damages improvements. Worker units could even transform the terrain to make the tile less productive.": "",
    "The section on Terrain describes how the output of each tile is affected by the terrain, the presence of special resources such as game or minerals, and improvements like roads, irrigation, and mines. Note that the tile on which the city itself rests -- the city center -- gets worked for free, without being assigned a citizen. The city's tile may also receive other benefits. In the classic ruleset, it always produces at least one food and one production point regardless of terrain; gains whatever advantages the terrain offers with an irrigation system (because cities come with water systems built-in), although this may not be used as a basis for irrigating other tiles; and is usually developed with roads (unless on a river and you do not yet know Bridge Building; upon learning it, river cities will also acquire roads). Other rulesets may differ in detail.": "",
    "The roles of citizens are controlled from the City dialog. Citizens working the land are represented by three numbers showing their output on the tile they are working. Clicking on these numbers will remove the citizen from the tile, turning them into a specialist (see the section on Specialists for more details); this can be seen in the row of citizen icons. You can click another tile to assign the citizen to work it, or click on the specialist icon to change their specialist role.": "",
    "Clicking on the city center tile in the city map will automatically choose citizen roles and tiles to work, with an emphasis on food production and hence growth. Citizen roles are also automatically assigned when a city grows; you may want to inspect cities that have just grown and adjust the role in which the new citizen has been placed. You can set different priorities for a city with the Citizen Governor; see its help section.": "",
    "Citizens have a nationality distinct from that of the state they inhabit. When a city grows due to food surplus, new citizens take the nationality of the city's current owner, but when a city is conquered or otherwise transferred, its citizens retain their original nationality, as do any immigrants. Units founding or contributing citizens to a city can also bring their own nationality.": "",
    "Citizens of another nationality will work in your cities just the same as your own, and behave the same in most respects, but they may become unhappy when you are at war with their associated state; their presence makes it cheaper for their state's agents to incite revolt in your cities; and if migration is enabled, they have an increased tendency to migrate to their state's cities. Over time, citizens may be assimilated into their home city, depending on ruleset settings.": "",
    "Some rulesets do not have nationality; in this case, citizens always consider their nationality to be that of their home city. If nationality is enabled, you can see the cultural makeup of your cities and any consequent effects on happiness in the City dialog, on the Happiness tab.": "",
    "Cities may be enhanced with a wide variety of buildings, which can improve their productivity, their military strength, or give them new abilities. See the sections on City Improvements and Wonders of the World for more information.": "",
    " Specialists": "专业人员：",
    "The first citizens of each city usually work the land, each toiling to yield up the resources of one terrain tile. However, there may be other specialist roles citizens can assume; in fact, taking another role is the only way they can stop working. A city may outgrow the land available for it to work, in which case some citizens must become specialists.": "",
    "All specialists enjoy enough privilege to remain perpetually content -- they do not contribute to unhappiness or to celebration. See the section on Happiness for more details.": "",
    "This section describes the available specialist roles, their effects, and their requirements, if any.": "",
    " Happiness": "欢乐",
    "Keeping your citizens happy (or at least content) is one of the most important objectives in Freeciv. When your citizens become unhappy, your cities will fall into disorder, which disrupts production; but when your citizens are happy, your cities will celebrate, and your production will increase greatly. (If migration is enabled, happiness also affects the relative desirability of cities; see the section on Migration for details.)": "市民可能是快乐的，满足的，或忧郁的。使您的市民保持快乐（或至少满足）是 Freeciv 中最重要的目标。当您的市民变得忧郁时，您的城市将陷入骚乱（这将中止生产）；而当您的市民快乐时，您的城市将进行庆祝，并且您的产出将极大提高。",
    "Each citizen working the land is either happy, content, unhappy, or angry. The normal state of a working citizen is contentment. However, as your cities grow larger, crowding causes citizens to become unhappy. In the classic rules, each citizen in a city after the fourth will be generated unhappy, instead of content.": "",
    "If the number of unhappy citizens in a city exceeds the number of happy citizens, the city falls into disorder. A city in disorder produces no food or production surplus, science, or taxes; only luxury production remains. Cities which are in disorder are also easier for enemy agents to incite to revolt. Prolonged disorder under certain governments can lead to a spontaneous national revolution, overthrowing your government.": "如果一个城市中的忧郁市民数超过了快乐市民数，城市将陷入骚乱。城市进入骚乱时，它将什么都不生产。处于骚乱中的城市更容易被敌方外交官或间谍煽动起义。民主制下持久的骚乱可能导致自发革命，推翻您的政府。",
    "It should be stressed that only citizens working the land vary in morale -- specialists enjoy enough privilege to remain perpetually content (see the section on Specialists). Thus one solution to the problem of an unhappy citizen is simply to assign that citizen to the role of a specialist. But if cities are ever to work more than four terrain tiles at once, the problem of morale must be confronted more directly.": "",
    "There are many ways of making unhappy citizens content, which does prevent disorder but is without further benefit. Producing happy citizens can balance the effect of unhappy citizens and also bring other benefits.": "",
    "Cities that are sufficiently large celebrate when at least half their citizens are happy and none remain unhappy. The effects of celebration vary; in the classic ruleset, they depend on your government type:": "",
    " - Under Anarchy or Despotism, you will not suffer the normal production penalty for tiles which produce more than 2 points of any resource (food, production, or trade).": " -　在无政府状态下或专制政府下，您将不再为出产超过2点（食物，物资或贸易）的方格承受损失。",
    " - Under Monarchy or Communism, your city will gain the trade bonus of Republican/Democratic governments: 1 bonus trade point in any tile which already produces at least 1 trade.": " -　在君主制或共产主义下，您的城市将得到共和制/民主制政府的贸易奖励：每个已经至少产出1点贸易的方格得到1点贸易的奖励。",
    " - Under a Republic or a Democracy, your city will enter \"rapture\": its population will increase by 1 each turn until there is no excess food or until the number of happy citizens is no longer sufficient for celebration. Without rapture, large cities can grow only by struggling to produce a food surplus -- which can be difficult enough -- and then waiting dozens of turns for their granary to fill.": " -　在共和制或民主制下，您城市的人口将以每回合1个的速度增长，知道没有多余的食物或者快乐市民数目不再足够庆祝。",
    "In small empires, as already stated, the fifth citizen in each city is the first unhappy one. As you gain more cities, this limit actually decreases, to simulate the difficulty of imposing order upon a large empire. The precise thresholds depend on government type; see the section on Government for details.": "",
    "Thus, you may find that founding or conquering a city triggers widespread disorder across your empire. Continued empire growth may lead to further penalty steps. In empires that grow beyond the point where no citizens are naturally content, angry citizens will appear; these must all be made merely unhappy before any unhappy citizens can be made content, but in all other respects behave as unhappy citizens.": "",
    "Luxury makes citizens happy. For every two luxury points a city produces, one content citizen is made happy (if there are no content citizens left, unhappy citizens become content then happy). Each city receives back some of the trade points it produces as luxury points according to your empire's tax rates; see the section on Trade. Luxury points may also be produced by other means, such as entertainer specialists in the classic ruleset.": "",
    "There are several city improvements that will make content those remaining citizens that are unhappy due to crowding, such as Temples and Colosseums in the classic rules. Some wonders of the world can also have this effect. See the appropriate sections for details.": "",
    "Military units can affect city happiness. Under authoritarian regimes this is helpful, as military units stationed in a city can prevent unhappiness by imposing martial law. However, under representative governments, citizens become unhappy when their city is supporting military units which have been deployed into an aggressive stance. This includes units not inside your national borders, a friendly city (including the cities of your allies), or a suitable base within three tiles of a friendly city; however, certain units (\"field units\") are inherently aggressive and cause unhappiness regardless of location.": "",
    "If you are at war with a civilization and some of your citizens are of that nationality, those citizens may also become unhappy.": "",
    "These forms of unhappiness are distinct from that caused by overcrowding, and cannot be offset by luxuries, or by most city improvements. In the classic ruleset, Police Stations and the Women's Suffrage wonder can offset unhappiness caused by units, and only a few wonders -- such as J.S. Bach's Cathedral -- can offset any kind of unhappiness, even that caused by military or diplomatic tensions.": "",
    "The Happiness tab on the city dialog will give detailed insight into the mood of the citizenry and its causes.": "",
    " Pollution": "污染",
    "Pollution can plague large cities, especially as your civilization becomes more industrialized. The chance of pollution appearing around a city depends on the sum of its population, aggravated by several technology advances, and its production point output. When this sum exceeds 20, the excess is the percent chance of pollution appearing each turn; this percentage is shown in the city dialog. (This chance of pollution also affects the risk of plague, if enabled in the ruleset; see the section on Plague.)": "",
    "Pollution appears as gunk covering the terrain tiles around the city. A polluted tile generates only half its usual food, production, and trade. The pollution can only be cleared by dispatching Workers, Settlers, or Engineers with the \"clean pollution\" order.": "",
    "When an unused tile becomes polluted, there is the temptation to avoid the effort of cleaning it; but the spread of pollution has far more terrible results -- every polluted tile increases the chance of global warming. Each time global warming advances, the entire world loses coastal land for jungles and swamps, and inland tiles are lost to desert. This tends to devastate cities and leads to global impoverishment.": "",
    "The risk of global warming is cumulative; the longer polluted tiles are left uncleaned, the higher the risk becomes, and the risk can linger for some time even after all pollution has been cleaned. If a long time passes with an elevated risk of warming, its effects will be all the more severe when it does occur.": "",
    " Plague": "删除条款",
    "Plague is a ruleset option, and is not enabled in the classic ruleset.": "",
    "When plague strikes a city, its population is reduced by one. Unless action is taken to reduce the risk of plague, this tends to act as a natural limit on city size. Rulesets which enable plague will typically have city improvements or other means to reduce the risk of plague.": "",
    "The risk of plague depends on city size (overcrowding leads to insanitary conditions) and on the pollution generated in a city. Also, plague can spread via trade routes (without regard for nationality); after a city has been struck by plague, it will remain infectious to its trade partners for several turns, increasing the risk of plague in those cities by a factor depending on the size of both cities.": "",
    "If migration is enabled, citizens will tend to prefer cities with a lower risk of plague.": "",
    " Migration": "水利",
    "Migration is the movement of citizens from one city to another based on the relative attractions of living in each city. Whether migration is enabled is controlled by the server option 'migration'; it is disabled by default.": "",
    "When migration is enabled, every few turns, a citizen of each city in the game may migrate to a nearby, more attractive city, either within the same nation or even across national borders (to a lesser extent, by default).": "",
    "You cannot directly prevent or direct the migration of citizens. However, you can influence the attractiveness of your cities. The following factors affect the perceived desirability of each city, in approximately decreasing order of importance. (Each factor counts for much more in the citizen's current city, as they prefer not to move without a compelling reason.)": "",
    " - City size.": "",
    " - The number of happy citizens. (To a lesser extent, unhappy and angry citizens reduce the desirability of a city.)": "",
    " - In rulesets where nationality is enabled, citizens have a strong preference to move to cities of their own nationality.": "",
    " - The presence of any wonder in a city will greatly increase its desirability (further wonders do not contribute except by the lesser effect of their build cost).": "",
    " - Capital cities are more attractive than other cities, all other factors being equal; in addition, citizens will never migrate out of a capital city.": "",
    " - A high risk of plague reduces a city's attractiveness.": "",
    " - Food surplus. (A food deficit reduces the desirability of a city.)": "",
    " - Cities that are further away are less desirable. The absolute maximum distance that a citizen is prepared to migrate is controlled by the server option 'mgr_dist'.": "",
    " - Trade surplus.": "贸＋",
    " - Luxury and science output.": "设置税务、娱乐和科研的比率",
    " - The quantity of city improvements (and wonders), measured by build cost.": "",
    " - Depending on the ruleset, a number of other factors such as government type and city improvements may increase or decrease the desirability of cities; these are noted in other sections of the help. (The classic ruleset contains no such effects.)": "",
    "Citizens will not migrate to cities which cannot increase in size to support them, for instance due to lack of a city improvement such as an Aqueduct. If the server option 'mgr_foodneeded' is set, they will not migrate to cities which would not have enough food to support them.": "",
    "Migration can even cause cities to be completely abandoned (ownership of any units being transferred to your nearest remaining city). However, cities with wonders will never be disbanded (so the wonder will not be destroyed), and the last citizen from your only remaining city will never migrate to another nation.": "",
    "Several of the details of migration can be changed with the 'mgr_*' server options.": "",
    "Cities may be improved with a wide variety of buildings, each with a different effect. Each city may have only one of each improvement, and some improvements require others to have been built first.": "",
    "It costs production points to build improvements, and once completed, many improvements require an upkeep of one or more gold pieces per turn. You may dismantle and sell an improvement, receiving one gold piece for each production point used in its construction, although you may only sell one improvement per city per turn. If a turn comes on which you cannot pay the upkeep on all of your improvements, some of them will be automatically sold; obviously this should be avoided as the improvements chosen might not be ones you would have preferred to sell.": "",
    "Most improvements become available only when you achieve certain technologies, while further advances can render some improvements obsolete, at which point they are automatically sold.": "",
    "Wonders are special buildings which can each be completed by only one player each game, and which often enhance their entire civilization. Unlike ordinary city improvements, which must be built with local production points, certain special units built in one city (Caravans and Freight in the classic ruleset) can contribute their full cost in production points towards the construction of a wonder in another city.": "",
    "Once built, a wonder is placed in the city that constructed it, and cannot be sold or destroyed (unless the entire city is destroyed). However, some wonders are made obsolete by the discovery of a certain advance, and lose their effect. Note the asymmetry: while you must personally achieve the advance required by each wonder to build it, it will be disabled when any player achieves the obsoleting advance.": "",
    "Units both offer mobility to your civilization and supply the violence with which it will survive and expand. The available units may be classified as military units, whose talents are those of defense and aggression, and a few noncombatants which support expansion, diplomacy, and trade.": "",
    "Units are usually built in cities using production points. Once built, units are owned by the city that built them (although they can later be re-homed while visiting a different city) and demand support from that city; this will be one of your major expenses. Most units require upkeep such as production points from their home city every turn, although some autocratic styles of government can force cities to support several units for free. If the upkeep of a unit outweighs its benefit, you can disband it; see the section on Production. A few units, particularly those that you start the game with, have no home city and thus require no upkeep.": "",
    "Most units begin every turn with one or more movement points. Every action undertaken by a unit consumes movement points.": "",
    "The most basic action is movement; units can move into any of the tiles surrounding their current location, subject to restrictions imposed by their physical nature (the terrain they are 'native' to), by diplomatic obligations (see the section on Diplomacy), and by enemy units (see the section on Zones of Control). The number of movement points consumed may depend on the type of terrain; see the Terrain help.": "",
    "A unit cannot move onto a tile occupied by an enemy unit, and when directed to do so will attack instead (if capable of attack), locking the two units in combat until one is destroyed. The outcome depends on the attributes of the units in question (hit points, attack and defense strength, and firepower); the Combat section describes the process in detail, and the following sections list specific units' attributes.": "",
    "Units' attributes can be further boosted by being veteran. Units may be built as veteran by means of certain city improvements or other influences; once built, units can also become veteran through experience (such as surviving combat), which may provide further levels of bonuses beyond those available from their initial training.": "",
    "Units which have been damaged in combat will regain hit points each turn in which they are not moved. Normally, a unit which has not moved will regain one hit point per turn. Units which are fortified gain an extra hit point. A unit which spends a turn in a city regains one third of its base hit points, and city improvements appropriate to the unit type can improve this further. In the field, bases on tiles can improve the recovery rate (for instance, fortresses in the classic ruleset have this effect); units must stay on the tile for a whole turn to get this recovery bonus. Wonders can also boost recovery (such as the United Nations in the classic ruleset). Damaged units in Sentry mode will wake up when they have regained all of their hit points.": "在战斗中受伤的部队在每个没有移动的回合中都将恢复其生命值。正常地，一个未移动的部队将恢复1点生命值。在拥有兵营的城市中的地面部队，或者拥有港口设施的城市中的海洋部队，或者拥有机场的城市中的空中部队，如果在城市中停留一个完整回合（而没有移动），将完全恢复生命值。否则，在城市中停留一个完整回合的部队将恢复其基本生命值的三分之一。在要塞中停留一个回合的部队多恢复额外的四分之一基本生命值点数。设防的部队多恢复1点生命值。如果玩家拥有奇迹联合国，该玩家的部队每个回合多恢复2点生命值，即使部队进行了移动也是如此。出了所有其它效果之外，直升飞机在没有结束于城市中的每个回合都将损失2点生命值（或少恢复2点生命值）。放哨模式下的受伤部队在恢复全部生命值后将自动唤醒。",
    "As technology advances, new types of units become available which obsolete existing types. When you discover such a new technology, your existing units remain intact, but you can no longer build new units of the obsolete type. While an obsolete unit is in one of your cities, you can choose to upgrade it to the latest equivalent by spending gold, with the cost increasing with the difference in production point cost between the two types. When a unit is upgraded, its hit points and movement points are preserved as a fraction of the total; however, in some rulesets (but not the classic rules) it will lose some or all of its veteran levels.": "",

    "   - If the defender is in a fortress (and not a city), its strength is doubled.": " -　如果防御者位于要塞中（并且不是城市），其力量被翻倍。",

However, alliance treaties come with obligations; you won't be able to ally with a player that is at war with a current ally unless you break the first treaty. If one of your allies declares war on another, the alliance with the aggressor is automatically broken. Breaking an Alliance will drop you to an Armistice treaty.

    "Your city has grown!  As a city grows, more citizens become\navailable that can be put to work in the fields or dedicated as\ncitizen specialists.  A city with two citizens gets to work two\ndifferent tiles, in addition to its center tile which is worked\nfor free.  In the city dialog, the map shows which tiles are worked\nand how much food, shields, and trade each provides.  Food is used\nto grow your city, shields are used for production of buildings\nand units, while trade provides taxable revenue that can be\nturned into science research, gold, or luxuries.\n\nClick on a worked tile to remove the citizen from that tile.  Then\nclick on an unworked tile to place a citizen there.  You may place\nup to two citizens on tiles, of course.  The remaining citizens are\nall specialists - by default they are all entertainers which provide\nonly luxuries (which will not be useful until later).": "",
    "Your city has grown again!  Now with three citizens you have\na fair amount of choice over where the city should focus its\nresources.  A city of size three or more may also build\nsettlers, which costs two units of population.\n\nIf your city is building settlers, you should consider buying them\nnow.  Open the city dialog and click on the Buy button.  This trades\nin gold (if you have enough of it) to instantly complete the\nproduction.": "",
    "Now your city has grown to size five.  As cities get larger unrest\nbecomes a problem.  A city of this size will usually have one unhappy\ncitizen unless pacifying effects are used; meaning one entertainer\nspecialist is required to keep your citizens content.  This is basically\na wasted citizen.\n\nThere are several things that can be done about this.  One quick fix\nis to build a temple (or other cultural building) that will make an\nunhappy citizen content (see the help on City Improvements for specs\non each building type).  As you get more large cities, it may pay off\nto change your tax rates (by pressing ctrl-T) to dedicate some of\nyour taxes directly to luxuries (every two luxuries will pacify one\ncitizen).  Building a marketplace enhances the benefit from this\nby providing +50%% luxuries to the city.": "",
    "Finally you have grown a city to size eight.  A size eight city can\nprovide substantial output provided you have enough luxuries to keep\nyour population content.\n\nTo grow a city beyond size eight requires an aqueduct.  If your city is\ngoing to continue to grow you should start building one soon.  Building\nan aqueduct requires the Construction technology, unless your city is next to lake or river.": "",
    "You have grown a city to size 16.  To grow\nit larger, however, you will need to build a Sewer System.  This\nrequires the Sanitation technology.": "",
    "Congratulations, you have grown a city to size 13.  A city this\nlarge can provide a tremendous amount of output if properly upgraded.\nMake sure you have enough taxes and cultural buildings to keep your\ncitizens content.  You should also make sure the city is upgraded\nwith buildings that provide bonuses to its output.  Library, Marketplace,\nFactory, and Offshore Platform are four good buildings that provide a\nlarge bonus to big cities.  Consider how much benefit each building\nwill provide and weigh this against its cost - for very large cities\nalmost all buildings are worthwhile.  Such large cities will also\nprovide enough taxable revenue (gold) to allow you to purchase some\nbuildings to accelerate their productions.": "",
    "You have built a settler unit.  Settlers are best used to build \nnew cities, so as to expand your civilization.  Move your settler\naway from your existing cities to find a spot for a new city.  When\nyou have picked a spot press B to build the city.\n\nAgain, cities are best built on open ground near water.  Grassland\nand plains provide food for the city.  Forests and hills provide\nthe resources (shields) needed for building things.  Rivers and ocean\ngive trade bonuses that provide civilization-wide benefits.  Desert,\ntundra, and mountains generally provide little output and are not\nof much use to small cities.  See the help on Terrain for more\ninformation about terrain specs.": "",
    "Your second Settlers should also be used to build a new city.\nNotice how when you move the Settlers away from your existing cities\nan outline is drawn around them.  This shows the area that would be\ncovered by a city built at this location; it fits in with the outline\nalready on the map view that shows which tiles are covered by your\nexisting cities.  Generally when building new cities you want to make\nsure that all tiles are covered by at least one city, but after that\nit is best that your cities overlap as little as possible.  Spreading\nout cities properly gives each city access to more resources, allowing\nthem to grow to larger sizes.": "",
    "You have built your first military unit!  Military units have two\nbasic purposes: attack and defense.  Each unit has an attack strength\nand a defense strength.  While a Warriors is a measly 1/1, a Phalanx\nis a much stronger defender with 2 defense (1/2).  A Catapult is a good\nattacking unit because it has 6 attack (6/1).\n\nUsually it is a good idea to keep one or two defenders in each city.\nImportant cities like your capital may deserve extra protection.  Units\nbuilt in one city may be sent to another city to defend (press the G\nkey to enter goto mode to move units easily over distances).  If you\nare at war, however, you may wish to move your unit toward an enemy\ncity to attack.  Be careful not to lose it though!": "",
    "You have built your first waterborne unit.  These can transport\nother units across water, allowing you to explore and settle new\nlands.  You can load land units onto your boat in one of two ways.\nWhen your boat and the unit you want to transport are in the same\ncity, select the latter and press L to load the unit; or if the boat\nis adjacent to a land tile, you can move the unit from there onto the\nboat.  When you want to disembark, select the transported unit and\npress U, or move it onto a land tile.": "",
    "You have built a Barracks.  This building will make any military\nunits you build start out as veterans.  Veteran units are stronger\nthan inexperienced (green) troops, and will survive longer in\ncombat.  See the help on City Improvements for more information\nabout this and other buildings.\n\nYou probably want to start building a military unit in the city\nthat built the Barracks.  A barracks are a significant investment\nand have a small upkeep as well, so it is not a good idea to let\nthem go to waste.": "",
    "Your city cannot build a settler.  Settlers take two units of\npopulation to build, so a city of size one or two cannot build one without\ndisbanding the city.\n\nTo remedy this, you need to adjust the citizens in the city to\nprovide more food so as to grow the city faster.  Cities that\ndo not have much food should not try to build settlers.  When\nfounding a new city, make sure it is built on terrain that provides\nenough food - grassland is best; plains or hills are almost as good.": "",
    "You have researched your first technology!  Technological advances\nare an integral concept in Freeciv.  As you increase your technology\nlevel new units, buildings, governments, and various free bonuses will\nbecome available to you.\n\nFor now, go over into the Research report and play around a little.\nPress F6 to open the Research report (or click on the Research tab in\nthe main window area).  Find the technology called Republic and click\non it.  Now Republic has been set as your technology goal; this means\nthe next advance on the path toward this technology will automatically\nbe chosen to research.  In the top of the window it shows how much\nscientific research you are accomplishing each turn - research (bulbs)\ncomes from the taxable trade in your cities.  In the bottom of the\nwindow is the tech tree; here you may left-click to set the research\ntarget or research goal, or right-click to get help about a particular\ntechnology.  When you are done playing around click on the View tab\n(F1) to return to the map view.": "",
    "Now you have researched your second technology.  Go back into the\nResearch report (F6) and take a quick look at your progress.  If you\nset Republic as your technology goal earlier, a new research target\nshould have been chosen for you automatically.  If you do not have\nany goal set, however, there will not be any new target chosen until\nthe end of the turn.\n\nIn the turn when you complete your research, you can pick a new tech\nto research.  However, switching targets midway through researching a\nparticular technology costs you all of the research done on\nit so far.  Setting your technology goal wisely means you do not have\nto worry about picking a new research target each time you finish\nresearching a technology.": "",
    "You have successfully completed research into The Republic.  This\ntechnology is particularly useful because it allows a new form of\ngovernment.  The government your civilization follows is very\nimportant in determining your development.  In the beginning you\nstarted as a Despotism, a very inefficient form of government.  Later\ngovernment options will give you some choice of whether your\ncivilization is to be a peaceful trading nation or a conquering\njuggernaut.  Each has advantages.\n\nFor now, you probably want to switch straight into Republic.  In the\nCivilization menu, go to the Government submenu and choose\nRepublic.  Yes you want a revolution!  Changing governments means\ngoing through a few turns of anarchy, so it is not without cost.\nHowever Republic is a substantially better form of government\nthan Despotism so the investment will soon pay off.": "",
    "Your unit has found a Hut.  These are small villages scattered across\nthe landscape.  When a unit enters one, several things may happen.  The\nmost likely outcome is that you will find resources worth a small\namount of gold.  However it is also possible to find technologies or\nmercenary units inside a hut.  Some huts contain native settlers\nthat will join your civilization and bring a new city into your\nempire.  Finally, some huts contain barbarians which will kill your\nunit instantly.  On average, it is beneficial to search out and enter\nany huts you find as soon as possible.": "",
